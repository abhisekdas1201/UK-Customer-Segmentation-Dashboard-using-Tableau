# UK-Customer-Segmentation-Dashboard-using-Tableau

This is a BFSI dashboard which is designed using Tableau 2022.4 BI tool. For making this dashboard I have used a MS Excel dataset which I have collected from web. This dashboard gives us the insights on customers segmentation by 4 different states of United Kingdom like England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. This dashboard gives us charts on customer segmentation by states, age, gender, balance and jobs.

**For creating this dashboard I have learned the below things on tableau** :
